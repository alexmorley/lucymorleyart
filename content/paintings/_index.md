Through her botanical works, Lucy wishes to shine a light on the beauty and tranquility of the plant world, and use the power of this imagery to create an uplifting and calming effect on the viewers and the interior spaces. Her paintings are a real celebration of our living and breathing natural environment.

Lucy works with water-based paints, often adding fine dot detailing to add a unique and contemporary feel to the work.
