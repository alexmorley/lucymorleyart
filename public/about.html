Lucy Morley is a British artist from London who studied Fine Art at Leeds University before attending Falmouth Art College in Cornwall where she gained a distinction in her Masters of Art & Environment. Since graduating in 2011, she has worked for several interior and design companies, most recently for 'de Gournay' who produce exquisite hand-painted wallpapers and fabrics. Currently she spends her time working between Cornwall and London.

Lucy's contemporary botanical projects are led by her passion for the natural ecosystems around the world and how we are all connected through nature. Her work is created to promote a greater awareness and care towards our local and global environments, and to inspire interest in subjects that may sometimes be left overlooked. Lucy also leads workshops related to botanical art and mandala painting to share her passion with others in the community.

As a lover of nature and a yoga enthusiast, Lucy is very keen to transmit through her work the meditative quality and healing power of the natural world to uplift people and spaces. Her meticulous attention to detail and care for each project gives Lucy's work its unique and sensitive style.

Treading as lightly on the planet as she can to create and display her work, Lucy uses water-based paints and inks, and her materials are responsibly sourced, recycled, or hand-made where possible.

Lucy enjoys to collaborate on projects and work on private commissions, and is great at helping her clients to realise their ideas.
